this program can function as a calculator. it haa the capability of performing 11 operations on one or two integers: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, modulus, shift left, shift right, bitwise and, bitwise or, bitwise xor, and bitwise not. it prompts the user for two integers and an operator. it takes the operator (type char) into a switch function in order to carry out the selected of the 11 different operations. it prints the result of the operation back out to the user. 

this program relies on the stdio.h and math.h libraries.
